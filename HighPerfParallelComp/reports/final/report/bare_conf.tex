% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of the IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off
% such as if a citation ever needs to be enclosed in parenthesis.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 5.0 (2009-03-20) and later if using hyperref.sty.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/cite
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.

%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or

%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%\fi
% subfig.sty, written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern replacement
% for subfigure.sty, the latter of which is no longer maintained and is
% incompatible with some LaTeX packages including fixltx2e. However,
% subfig.sty requires and automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty
% which will override IEEEtran.cls' handling of captions and this will result
% in non-IEEE style figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure
% and invoke subfig.sty's "caption=false" package option (available since
% subfig.sty version 1.3, 2005/06/28) as this is will preserve IEEEtran.cls
% handling of captions.
% Note that the Computer Society format requires a larger sans serif font
% than the serif footnote size font used in traditional IEEE formatting
% and thus the need to invoke different subfig.sty package options depending
% on whether compsoc mode has been enabled.
%
% The latest version and documentation of subfig.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/subfig




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure.
% Be aware that LaTeX2e kernels dated 2015 and later have fixltx2e.sty's
% corrections already built into the system in which case a warning will
% be issued if an attempt is made to load fixltx2e.sty as it is no longer
% needed.
% The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/fixltx2e


%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/stfloats
% Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as the IEEE does not allow
% \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the IEEE should note
% that the IEEE rarely uses double column equations and that authors should try
% to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the cuted.sty or midfloat.sty
% packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as the IEEE does not format its papers in
% such ways.
% Do not attempt to use stfloats with fixltx2e as they are incompatible.
% Instead, use Morten Hogholm'a dblfloatfix which combines the features
% of both fixltx2e and stfloats:
%
% \usepackage{dblfloatfix}
% The latest version can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/dblfloatfix




% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/url
% Basically, \url{my_url_here}.




% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.
% (Unless specifically asked to do so by the journal or conference you plan
% to submit to, of course. )

\begin{abstract}
Jacobi-Schwarz, a.k.a Schwarz Method, is a parallel algorithm that iteratively solves large scale linear systems for boundary value problems. It has shared regions across subdomains and thus converges faster than Block Jacobi. In this project, Jacobi-Schwarz is implemented with Remote Memory Access and multi-thread Intel Math Kernel Library. Multiple shared windows are used to reduce runtime. Comparing to MPI send/recv, implementation with RMA is three times slower. Result also shows that with different grow values, optimal number of threads differs.

\section{Introduction}
% no \IEEEPARstart
A boundary value problem is a differential equation together with a set of additional constraints, called the boundary conditions. Boundary value problems are widely used in several branches in physics\cite{wiki}. For example, given a temperature distribution in a square room and heat sources and sinks, solve for the temperature at each grid point. In this problem, a linear equation system shows the connection between adjacent grids with boundary conditions that the values on the boundary of the room are known. 

There exists many efficient single process solver to solve such a boundary value problem. However, as the scale of the problem grows to the order of millions of grids, it is no longer solvable using singe process because storing the entire linear system requires huge memory and solving time could be extremely long. Thus, parallel solving algorithms such as Jacobi-Schwarz should be used instead. 

In this project, I implemented Jacobi-Schwarz in two ways using MPI send/recv and RMA to divide the huge problem into much smaller local problem. Then the local linear equation system is solved by Intel Math Kernel Library with multi-threading. 

The rest of the report is organized as following. Section II will introduce the temperature problem in details. Design and optimization of the codes are explained in Section III. Section VI will introduce experiment results, followed by conclusion in Section V.

% even when the captionsoff option is in effect. However, because
% of issues like this, it may be the safest practice to put all your
% \label just after \caption rather than within \caption{}.

% Note that often IEEE papers with subfigures do not employ subfigure

% Be aware that for subfig.sty to generate the (a), (b), etc., subfigure
% labels, the optional argument to \subfloat must be present. If a
% subcaption is not desired, just leave its contents blank,
% e.g., \subfloat[].


% Note that the IEEE does not put floats in the very first column
% - or typically anywhere on the first page for that matter. Also,
% in-text middle ("here") positioning is typically not used, but it
% is allowed and encouraged for Computer Society conferences (but
% not Computer Society journals). Most IEEE journals/conferences use
% top floats exclusively. 
% Note that, LaTeX2e, unlike IEEE journals/conferences, places
% footnotes above bottom floats. This can be corrected via the
% \fnbelowfloat command of the stfloats package.


\section{Problem Definition}
\subsection{Room Temperature}
Given a square room, divide it into \emph{n} by \emph{n} grids. Each grid has a number indicating its temperature. The 2D problem is solving the temperature at each grid point. 

\begin{figure}[!h]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=2.5in]{fig1.jpg}
\caption{\emph{n} by \emph{n} temperature grids}
\label{fig1}
\end{figure}

All values at the boundary are known. In this project, all boundary values are set to zero. To simplify the problem, the connection between each grid and its neighbors is shown in (\ref{eq1:temperature}). 

\begin{equation}
\label{eq1:temperature}
4u_c = u_N + u_W + u_S + u_E + f_c
\end{equation}

where $u_c$ denotes the temperature at grid $c$, $u_N$, $u_W$, $u_S$, $u_E$ denote the temperatures of its neighbors and $f_c$ denotes the source or sink at grid $c$. Then the 2D temperature problem can be formulated as the following matrix format: 

$$  Au = f $$

\subsection{Jacobi-Schwarz}
Since \emph{n} could be as large as $10^3$, it is much more efficient to use parallel algorithms to solve the problem. Using Jacobi-Schwarz will significantly reduce runtime and optimize memory allocation. 

The Jacobi-Schwarz method divides the grids into many subdomains. Each subdomain only stores local values and it is a similar local boundary value problem, sharing the boundaries with adjacent subdomains. 

\begin{figure}[!h]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=2.5in]{fig2.jpg}
\caption{subdomains in Jacobi-Schwarz}
\label{fig2}
\end{figure}

To iteratively solve the entire problem, each subdomain first send and receive the values from its neighbors. Then solve the local linear system. The process ends when residual is small enough or number of iterations reaches a user defined threshold. 


\section{Parallel Design and Optimization}

To parallelize the algorithm, each subdomain is a process and runs its own linear system solver using Intel MKL. Since the boundary values are not locally stored, remote memory access is used to get values from another subdomain. Each subdomain has 4 separate shared windows, which are the top/bottom \emph{k} rows and left/right \emph{k} columns, communicating with its 4 neighbors(top, bottom, left, right). \emph{k} is the grow value. Also, the neighbors in 4 corners can get the values they need from these 4 windows too. 

Using multiple windows instead of a single giant window can reduce the cases where multiple processes try to read data from the same window. It means the lock time of the data should be reduces. However, on the other hand, there are more locks to acquire and release. It is a trade-off between the number of locks and the holding time of the locks. More detailed experiment results are shown in Section V. 

Figure \ref{fig3} shows the solving process of each process. After generating a random initial guess, the major iteration starts. It continuously solves the local problem until the global residual is small enough of number of iterations reaches its limit. 

\begin{figure}[!h]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=2.9in]{fig3.jpg}
\caption{solving process}
\label{fig3}
\end{figure}

Two barriers are used in each iteration. Firstly, make sure that writing local buffers is complete before allowing other processes to read from the buffer. Secondly, start computing global residual norm only when all the processes finish solving their local systems and have the correct local residual. There two barriers and the locks guarantees that all the data is ready when it is needed and no race condition exists. 

\section{Experiment Result}

All the experiments were run on Gotham mic4. Problem scale is 10 by 6 processes and each local problem has 100 by 100 grids. Default process pinning was used. 

The comparison between using MPI send/recv, single-window RMA and multi-window RMA is shown in Figure \ref{fig4}. X-axis is grow value and y-axis is time per iteration. MPI send/recv was used as time baseline. Each process uses single thread in MKL. 

\begin{figure}[!h]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=2.9in]{fig4.jpg}
\caption{MPI send/recv, single-window RMA and multi-window RMA}
\label{fig4}
\end{figure}

These three methods have exactly the same results because the solving process is the same. The only difference is how to communicate between processes. According to the data, using RMA is approximately three times slower than using MPI send/recv. And using a single window for RMA is better if growth is large. The reason is that if growth is large, the overlapping area at the corners becomes larger, which is less efficient. But larger growth won't affect single-window RMA since all the values are still only stored once. 

With multi-threading in MKL, the results are shown in Figure \ref{fig5}. The baseline for time per iteration is using single thread and growth being zero. For different grow value, optimal number of threads are different. When grow=0, using 4 threads has the best performance. When grow=1, using 2 threads has the best performance. When grow=10, using 4 threads has the best performance. To get more accurate runtime, maximum number of iterations is set to 500.

\end{figure}

\section{Conclusion}
In this project, Jacobi-Schwarz method is implemented with RMA and multi-threads in Intel MKL. Compared with MPI send/recv, RMA is less efficient for transferring data between processes. However, it is a more flexible way to access data in another process. When allocating shared window, the process doesn't need to know which process will use its data. On the other hand, MPI send/recv requires a very clear statement of which two processes are communicating.
